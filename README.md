You may imagine or expect to me as alike Tomcat and/or Rails that are able to manage Databases and WebAPIs.
Well, it does not hit the center, but OK, let’s start to there. You see what I am in my video(https://jetelina.org/im-happy-you-wanna-know-me-more/)

1.Who I am

2.What I am

3.Where I am

4.When I am

5.How I am

6.Which I am

7.JSON! JSON! JSON!

1.Who I am

I am a server side program ‘who’ is written in Julia. I am very friendly, but not AI.

2.What I am

I can handle some data base, PostgreSQL/MySQL/Redis/MongoDB, at once. ‘at once’ meaning is ‘coexistence’. Of course you can choose only one data base as usal.
‘handle’ meaning is ‘create table’, ‘create DBI’, ‘publish the DBI as WebApi’, and of course can execute the DBI/WebApi both in real and in testing.

3.Where I am

I work between HTTPD server and Data Base, see below figure. Simply I pass the data from a data base to the httpd. The data form is JSON and the data are depend on the DBI that is created by you and me.

4.When I am

Oops, this is a difficult to answer. You touch me when you need to create a new DBI/WebApi, table, add new data….. and so on. And may you sometime wann see my conditions: WebApi execution speed, access numbers….. Or when you are in down. (^o^)v

5.How I am

Yes, I can explain this clearly. The details are in ‘How to use(https://jetelina.org/how-to-use-me/)‘ for (1)-(3) and ‘How to call()https://jetelina.org/how-to-call-your-created-webapis/‘ for (2).

(1)create table on database: by uploading a csv file to me.

(2)create DBI: you can create ‘select’ and ‘update’ DBIs by selecting table columns, ‘insert’ and ‘delete’ DBIs are under my control.

(3)publish the DBI as WebApi: each DBI has its unique api name, this is to be the WebApi name, you just call the name.

(4)execute the DBI/WebApi: order me with typing ‘test api’…. then i guide you

6.Which I am

I know every present applications, no matter which client side or server side, are operated by ‘click icons’ and/or ‘entering commands on a screen’.
These are developed in progressing computer systems. ‘Icons’ are be friendly, imagiable the functions, ‘commands’ are be known by dectating in many blogs. But you have to learn their meaning, location on the screen everytimes when you start to use them. These ‘knowladge’ is called ‘skill’ and ‘experience’. Is that true? Know them or not makes a hierarchy as a beginner or an expert.
However, you may had an experience in shouting, ‘I just wanna upload this file to there, but can’t find a proper function in icons, or do not know the command to run it’. You may think “do everything if i asked ‘upload’”. This is very natural.
In my case, you just type ‘wanna upload file’ or just ‘file uplaod’, adding ‘please’ is more friendly to me, e.g ‘file uplaod please’.＼(^o^)／
Like that, you do not need to study how to do something anymore, just ask me what you wanna do in our chatbox.

7.JSON! JSON! JSON!

Every data is passed in JSON. I mean no matter which Plan A and Plan B, Please refer the form in ‘How to call(https://jetelina.org/how-to-call-your-created-webapis/)‘.
